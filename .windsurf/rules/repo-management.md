## Overview

This is my personal dotfiles repo. This is where I house and manage all my dotfiles which I use for various setups, apps and services.

## System Details

I am currently using Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS as my main OS, which actually runs on a dedicated SSD. This repo is housed in another drive, where I have attached this to GIT and manage versioning.

## GNU Stow

I prefer to, and have been using GNU Stow to properly symlink and manage all my dotfiles. The current repo is located at `/mnt/storage/Code/Personal/dotfiles` directory, and all the stows points to my `$HOME` directory.

## Preferences

- I always like to have my code files clean and clutter-free.
- I always refactor and split the files into dedicated and manageable parts, so that it is easier to make changes.
- I always prefer to "safely" perform any operations like imports, sourcing, etc. This is because I switch to different OS on a regular basis and would like if things don't break.
- I always prefer to use the latest stable versions of the tools and packages.

I would like to be notified if I am making any mistakes or guessing things wrongly. Keeping the OS stable and performant is our only goal. On the process, if we can make sure if things look clean and beautiful, then nothing like it.
